Pre-calculated threshold (mean + 2*std): 230.99 V

I named it "mean" because that's the standard term for the arithmetic average—the central value of your data calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values.

AOF UPDATES:
The user wants to modify the code so that "Automatic Feature Optimization" (AFO) is displayed live as the program runs. Currently, the AFO block is executed only once after the loop. The task involves making AFO results update during the iteration as rows are processed.

I’ll need to adjust the code to update the AFO outputs in real-time, probably by including it inside the loop or by periodically printing results during the iteration.

The user wants to see live updates of Automatic Feature Optimization (AFO) during the program's execution, not just after processing the dataset. I can modify the existing code by updating the AFO every few rows inside the loop.

I’ll keep a placeholder for AFO results, like afo_placeholder = st.empty(), and update it every 10 rows. I'll also keep a live dataframe, df_live, that stores processed rows.

Since I’ve done something similar before, I’ll adapt that code to fit the user’s request and produce an integrated code block showing live AFO updates.
